\begin{abstract}
This work presents a closed-form mathematical model describing the configuration of physical reality prior to observation. We formalize a harmonic field substrate, denoted as \textit{Origin Light}, that satisfies boundary-closed energy stability without invoking temporal or observational parameters. The model derives logical symmetry, curvature emergence, and energy localization from intrinsic field behavior. This foundational geometry sets the stage for observation dynamics and unified interaction geome...

The standard approach in physics presumes the presence of time, space, and measurable events...
